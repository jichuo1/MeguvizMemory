 * external_id must uniquely and stably identify the complete origin backing in
 * this Memory runtime, including across all other external import adapters. It
 * is NOT a hash of the Compute identity tuple. The caller must coordinate IDs
 * across all adapters and Memory runtimes: the same physical backing must have
 * exactly one managing Memory runtime, and aliased virtual mappings cannot be
 * detected. The caller retains its lease through this call and must not unmap
 * the adapter's mapping, mutate through aliases, or unload either runtime or
 * callback code while the imported owner/Memory leases exist.
 *
 * On success out contains one ordinary Memory allocation owner; Memory retains
 * the Compute map through the last lease, including across begin_close. On
 * failure out is zero. Required out_compute_status is set to the last
 * synchronous Compute error (0 if the failure originated in Memory).
 * on_unmap_error is also required. A later unmap failure
 * is reported through on_unmap_error; checked release poisons
 * the domain and preserves its charge and registry claim. If unmap instead
 * fails while rolling back an import rejected before Memory retained it, this
 * returns MGMEM_COMPUTE_ROLLBACK_QUARANTINED; no Memory claim exists to retain.
 * The caller must stop using that backing and coordinate all subsequent
 * imports. Compute normally permits this failure
 * only after a contract violation such as an external unmap.
 * A successful foreign unmap can recycle the storage before the callback
 * returns while its Memory claim remains live. A concurrent provider reusing
 * that address may conservatively be rejected or isolated as an overlap;
 * checked release has no two-phase handoff with the foreign allocator.
